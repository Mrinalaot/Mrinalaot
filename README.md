## MRINAL KANTI GHOSH

I am a full stack developer with more than 3.5+ years of experience in frontend, backend, and cloud (AWS). I have hands on experience working with web frameworks and technologies. 

I have extensively worked on react, node (Serverless, Express, Nestjs, etc) and typescript for the last 3 years. I have a keen interest in learning new technologies to make the development job easy.
